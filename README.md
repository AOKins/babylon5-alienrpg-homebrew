# Babylon 5: An Alien RPG Homebrew Module
An unofficial modification/add-on to Free League Publishing's Alien RPG rule-system on Foundry VTT.

Inspired by MickeyP2K's similar project of a Babylon 5 system, this module aims to provide a means of creating a Babylon 5 themed homebrew based on the Alien RPG without being a distinct system.  Enabling migration of Alien RPG materials into the Babylon 5 universe and making maintainable support easier.  At the moment the goal is for minimal changes to the Alien RPG system to facilitate Babylon 5 worldbuilding (so current only gameplay addition being telepathy and a Psi rating).

# Features
- Babylon 5 themed dice textures for Dice so Nice ('5's are Sixes, '0' are Ones)
- Psi Rating attribute & Telepathy skill
- (Work in Progress) Babylon 5 themed assets

# VTT Support
- v0.10

# Homebrew Content

## Telepathy
While a Telepath's capability is ultimately dependent on their Psi Rating, a telepath's Psi Rating cannot be changed (generally) but their refinement of utilizing their special talents can be.  This is represented by a Telepath's skill in telepathy being based on their Empathy attribute as well as being a distinct skill.

Future work on the homebrew is devising Talents specific to a Telepath only, with possible restrictions including their Psi Rating.  Specific rules in regards to challenges such as blocking a scan from another Telepath is also to be developed and presented (as this may be a case wher a telepath's Psi Rating will factor in).
